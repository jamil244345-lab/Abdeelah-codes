        <p> my name is <strong> <Abdul-basit Isiraojie</strong>,I'm passionate in learning new things about my religion and 
            tech,such as web development ,Arabic and islamic knowledge and nasheeds(islamic poem)
            i try my best not to get involve with haram earning and make sure i earn in Halaal ,bcos it's important to 
            please our lord (ALLAH) even if we happen to displease ourselves in the process.
            cos in reality,if you u really check well ,when you please ALLAH you later find out that it's for your own goood.
